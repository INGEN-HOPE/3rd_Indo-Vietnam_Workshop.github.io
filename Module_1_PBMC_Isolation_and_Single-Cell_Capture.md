## 1. Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Overview 

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms have rapidly improved in both
accuracy and throughput while becoming far more affordable. This shift
has transformed how we study gene expression, enabling deeper and more
comprehensive transcriptome profiling. Within transcriptomics, two
widely used NGS-based strategies are bulk RNA sequencing (bulk RNA-seq)
and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Bulk RNA-seq measures the
combined gene expression of many cells together, producing an average
expression profile for a tissue or sample. In contrast, scRNA-seq
profiles gene expression in individual cells, providing an unprecedented
view into cellular diversity and allowing us to resolve complex tissues
into distinct cell types and states. scRNA-seq is a technology designed
to quantify the transcripts inside each cell in a sample. Because RNA
reflects genes that are actively being transcribed, scRNA-seq offers a
“snapshot” of the cellular transcriptome at the time the sample is
collected. Since the first scRNA-seq studies emerged around 2009 by Tang
et al., the field has progressed quickly, becoming a state-of-the-art
approach for mapping cell types, identifying rare populations, and
uncovering how different cells behave in health and disease. Instead of
treating a tissue as one blended signal, scRNA-seq reveals
heterogeneity; for example, how immune cells in the same organ can exist
in multiple functional states, or how small subsets of cells may drive
inflammation, recovery, or pathology.

At a practical level, scRNA-seq workflows convert biological signals
into a digital, cell-by-gene matrix that can be analysed
computationally. While protocols differ by platform, the core
experimental steps are broadly consistent: (1) isolate single cells, (2)
capture cells individually, (3) lyse cells and reverse transcribe RNA
into cDNA, (4) amplify cDNA, and (5) prepare sequencing-ready libraries.
One of the most important and labor-intensive stages is single-cell
isolation and capture, which can be achieved using methods such as FACS,
MACS, microfluidics-based capture (e.g., 10x Genomics), or microwell
systems (e.g., BD Rhapsody). High-throughput, tag-based platforms rely
on cell barcodes (to label which cell a transcript came from) and Unique
Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) (to label original molecules), enabling
digital transcript counting and reducing PCR amplification bias critical
for robust quantification.

scRNA-seq is powerful for infectious-disease research because it
resolves “host response” into distinct, cell-type–specific programs
rather than treating immunity as a single averaged signal: it can
reveal, for example, that ostensibly similar macrophages confronted with
bacteria diverge into different trajectories, some permissive to
microbial replication, others strongly microbicidal and clearing
infection, and others exhibiting weaker or alternative response states
insight that is central to understanding pathogenesis, separating
protective from pathological immune programs, and informing therapy.
Beyond profiling the host alone, scRNA-seq provides a single-cell
transcriptomic readout that can capture substantial transcriptomic
complexity (including isoform usage/alternative splicing signals,
low-abundance transcripts, and non-coding RNAs such as lncRNAs), and
with appropriate analytical frameworks the same datasets can be mined
for host–microbe interactions by assigning microbial transcript signals
to specific host cells and linking them to the host transcriptional
programs those cells activate. This “dual RNA-seq” concept at
single-cell resolution is particularly valuable for intracellular
pathogens, because it can connect infection status (which cells contain
microbial reads) with the host state changes infection induces,
effectively tying pathogen identity and host response together in one
measurement. A practical limitation is that many common scRNA-seq
chemistries rely on poly-A/oligo(dT) priming and therefore enrich
polyadenylated transcripts, so microbial detection varies by organism
and transcript features, but microbial reads can still be recovered in
many settings (especially when abundant or capture-compatible) and,
together with specialized pipelines, enable integrated analysis of
microbial diversity and host response. Finally, combining scRNA-seq with
multimodal single-cell methods such as scATAC-seq, CITE-seq, and V(D)J
profiling expands this into a broader toolkit for simultaneously
dissecting immune repertoires, regulatory landscapes, and cell-cell
communication during infection.

Microwell vs Droplet-Based Techniques:

Drop-seq and microwell-based single-cell platforms differ mainly in how
they isolate and barcode individual cells and what that implies for
handling, cell stress, capture efficiency, and workflow flexibility.
Drop-seq is a droplet-based microfluidic approach: cells and barcoded
beads are co-encapsulated into nanoliter droplets, enabling
high-throughput single-cell capture but relying on microfluidic channel
performance and exposing cells to higher shear stress than
gravity-settling methods. In contrast, microwell technology (illustrated
here using BD Rhapsody as an example) is gravity-based, loading cells
into an array of wells, where each cell is paired with a single barcoded
bead. Practically, microwell capture is often presented as more tolerant
of fragile cell types and less prone to “channel clogging” losses, with
reported high capture rates and relatively low multiplet rates across a
range of input loads. Finally, microwell workflows may offer added
experimental flexibility, such as sample multiplexing and an option
between whole-transcriptome and targeted gene panels (trading breadth
for lower sequencing depth/cost), whereas Drop-seq is typically
positioned as a broad, droplet-based whole-transcriptome method within
the droplet.

## **2. PBMC Isolation Protocol from Blood**

**2.1 Introduction**

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are isolated from whole blood
using Histopaque density-gradient centrifugation to obtain a
high-quality, viable immune cell population suitable for single-cell
transcriptomic profiling. PBMC isolation enriches lymphocytes &
monocytes while removing erythrocytes & granulocytes, thereby minimizing
background noise & technical variability.

## **4. Single-Cell Capture In a Microwell**

**4.1 Introduction**
<img src="media/image2.png" style="width:5.85429in;height:1.69601in" />

(Shum et al., 2019)

Single-cell capture using the BD Rhapsody Single-Cell Analysis System
enables the analysis of gene expression at the resolution of individual
cells, allowing the study of cellular heterogeneity within complex
biological samples. In this method, a single-cell suspension is loaded
into a microwell-based cartridge where individual cells are isolated
into separate wells. Barcoded magnetic cell capture beads carrying
oligonucleotides with a cell-specific barcode, unique molecular
identifier (UMI), and poly(dT) sequence are introduced to pair with the
cells. Upon cell lysis, the released polyadenylated mRNA hybridizes to
the poly(dT) region on the beads. The

beads containing captured mRNA are then magnetically retrieved and
washed to remove impurities. Reverse transcription is performed directly
on the beads to synthesize complementary DNA (cDNA), preserving both
cell identity and transcript information.

**4.2 Priming and treating the BD Rhapsody Cartridge  
**

1.  Place the 5-mL LoBind tube in the Express instrument drawer.

2.  Set the Express instrument slider front to the ‘Waste’ and side to

**4.3 Counting and preparing a single-cell suspension for cartridge
loading**

We need \~25000 cells for the loading, which can be calculated using the
formula:

Since we need the total cells desired to load = \~ 25000 cells.
Calculate the volume to load.

4.  Remove the tube from the magnet and add 200 µL of Exonuclease I mix.
    \> Mix by pipetting.

5.  Incubate the bead suspension on the thermomixer at 37°C, 1,200 rpm,
    \> for 30 minutes.  
    \>  
    \> **Note:** *If only one thermomixer is available, allow it to \>
    equilibrate to 80°C. Keep samples on ice until the temperature is \>
    reached.  
    \> *

6.  Incubate the bead suspension on the thermomixer at 80°C for 20 \>
    minutes with no shaking.  
    \>  
    \> **Note:** *Do not exceed the specified temperature or incubation
    \> time.  
    \> *

7.  Place the tube on ice for approximately 1 minute.

8.  Place the tube on the magnet for ≤ 1 minute until the solution \>
    becomes clear. Remove and discard the supernatant.

9.  Remove the tube from the magnet and add 200 µL of cold Bead \>
    Resuspension Buffer. Mix by pipetting.

> **Note:** *Stopping point: Exonuclease I–treated beads may be stored
> at 2–8°C for up to 3 months.*

24. Proceed to library preparation according to the Single-Cell Analysis
    \> Workflow with BD Rhapsody Systems.
